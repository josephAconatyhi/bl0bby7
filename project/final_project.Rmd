#  Introduction

Maryland drivers have a bad reputation. Whether it comes up from Marylanders or people outside the state, it can be agreed upon that we just aren't very good at driving. But I wanted to see if there was any statistical backing behind this phenomenon. Through seeing how we better or worse we are compared to other states, we can identify if changes need to be made in how we teach kids how to drive in Maryland. And we can possibly confirm or deny that Maryland drivers ARE that bad.
